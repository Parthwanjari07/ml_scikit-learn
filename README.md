Medical Charges Prediction with Scikit-learn
This project explores the application of machine learning using Scikit-learn to predict medical charges for patients based on various personal parameters. The goal was to accurately forecast the costs associated with medical services, given factors such as smoking status, age, previous medical expenses, location, sex, and other relevant characteristics.

Key steps in the project include:

Data Preprocessing: Extensive data cleaning, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables were performed to prepare the dataset for modeling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualization tools like Seaborn and Matplotlib were utilized to uncover patterns, correlations, and insights within the data, such as the impact of smoking or age on medical charges.
Feature Engineering: Relevant features were selected and engineered to enhance the model's predictive power.
Model Development: Multiple machine learning models, including linear regression, decision trees, and random forests, were developed and fine-tuned to predict medical charges.
Model Evaluation: The models were evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared to determine their accuracy and effectiveness.
